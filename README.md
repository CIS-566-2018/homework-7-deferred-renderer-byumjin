### Standard Shadow Mapping

I used standard shadow mapping (as known as depthmap shadow).
Due to the size of my scene, it needed to use a huge resolution of the shadow map (like 4096 x 4096), for the performance of the other post-process effects, I could not do it.
The resolution of the shadow map is now 2048 x 2048.
